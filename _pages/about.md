I am a third-year Ph.D. Student at the Department of Computer Science, [George Mason University (GMU)](https://www.gmu.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Lannan Luo](https://lannan.github.io/index.html). Prior to joining George Mason, I earned the Bachelor degree in Computer Science in 2017 from Northeastern University in Shenyang, China, and obtained the Master degree from the University of Melbourne, Australia, in 2020.

My research mainly focuses on IoT Attacks and Defenses.
 <!-- My reserch interests include IoT vulnerability analysis, mobile computing and software engineering. -->
